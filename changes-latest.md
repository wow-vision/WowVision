### All Versions
* Hopefully again fixed the issue where certain npcs would not list their dialogue options. This was caused by certain npcs using a different window (the quest frame) to list their greeting text and quests.
* Refactored the UI code to better handle required delays in the WoW Speech APIs. Essentially this speeds up speech responsiveness for all versions of the game when navigating through UI elements.

### Burning Crusade Anniversary
* Fixed a bug where the quest log frame would not scroll correctly and report incorrect information for various buttons.
