### All Versions
* Added support for the item text frame (letters, books, etc.)
* Fixed a bug where adding an input to a binding with no inputs set would add the input twice.
* Fixed an issue where additional non-functioning elements would be listed for the options/game menu for versions of the game using newer Blizzard code (currently Retail and BCC Anniversary.)
* Reverted the change to UI tooltip processing made in the previous version. This should fix tooltips not being fully loaded before they are read out.
