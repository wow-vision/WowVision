# vision-core
Core functionality for the WowVision addon.

Note: This is the core of the addon and provides functionality used by all versions. This does not include addon .tocs, library files, etc. These are specific to each specific game version, as libraries and tocs change significantly based on the game version used. Clone a specific version's repository (which includes this core as a submodule) if you want to work on a specific addon.
