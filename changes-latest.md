### Burning Crusade Anniversary
* Fixed a bug where the quest log frame would not scroll correctly and report incorrect information for various buttons.
* Hopefully again fixed the issue where certain npcs would not list their dialogue options. This was caused by certain npcs using a different window (the quest frame) to list their greeting text and quests.
